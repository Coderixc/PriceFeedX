This Module will load NSE Top 100 Stocks and Their Price (Current LTP and 5 Day Previous Price) and will store all NSE Stocks Symbols in the Database(using Mysql).

Added feature Current Module: This will also Load NSE EQUITY BHAV COPY Daily in User Readable mode and Insert it In DataBase

I developed a very basic Software(Bot) that does the following task -
1. Automatically Fetch NSE Bhav copy,(Manual Click is also included) 
2. Programmed to do "Extract all" without human intervention. 
3. Added Another Panel which will present stats and folder structure, which is already extracted and it will verify if some file is missed.
4. Presented Log panel for all activity/Events for a Task done by Bot.

Donâ€™t hesitate to ask for any other materials/Information you think would be helpful. You can reach me at kchanchal78@gmail.com for any custom Inbuilt Software
